# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview
A Pandas-based analysis of district-wide standardized test results for a fictional
city school district. Aggregates student math and reading scores alongside school
budget and demographic data to surface performance trends that can inform strategic
decisions about school budgets and priorities.

## Analysis Summary

### District & School Summaries
- District-wide snapshot: total schools, students, budget, average scores,
  and passing rates
- Per-school breakdown of budget, per-student spending, scores, and passing rates

### Performance Rankings
- Top 5 highest-performing schools by overall passing rate
- Bottom 5 lowest-performing schools by overall passing rate

### Score Breakdowns
- Average math and reading scores by grade level (9th-12th) per school
- Performance by per-student spending range
- Performance by school size (small, medium, large)
- Performance by school type (charter vs. district)

---

## Key Findings
- Schools with lower per-student spending do not necessarily underperform —
  charter schools consistently outperform district schools regardless of budget
- Smaller schools tend to have higher overall passing rates than larger schools

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook
